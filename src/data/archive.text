I’m an AI optimist and want to help society adopt AI faster and safer. I believe that distributed trustless networks like blockchains are the the most robust internet infra for our financial, social, and technological systems and will play a vital role in AGI security. I scale myself by learning, building, and measuring all my feedback loops. I'm interested in AI alignment, ZK-circuits, and mech interpretability.

    "Hi there! I'm a fullstack engineer with 4 years of experience. After graduating from Columbia University in 2020, I've worked at Amazon (~1y backend) and BitGo (~2y fullstack wallet platform integration with multiple blockchains).",
    "I'm currently getting a Masters degree at UCI (graduating in Jun'24) while working on projects in the LLM space, an HPC product for Microsoft, and a few other tinkerings.",
    "I'm passionate about designing intuitive user experiences, creating robust internet infrastructure, and integrating all my feedback loops with AI.",

    "I keep myself busy. I'm currently working on these projects:
- freelancing at a seed stage AI evaluation startup to build LLM evaluators
- conducting mech interpretability research on open source LLMs at a deep learning lab at UCI
- working with Microsoft to help Azure clients estimate their HPC workloads for SPICE simulations
- building an AI chatbot to improve mental health
- volunteering at the UN's mission in Gaza to build a virtual hospital that treats 1000s of patients
- integrating AI into all my feedback loops by building my own tech",
"My journey began at Columbia, where I won a hackathon that landed me an internship at ConsenSys. I founded Columbia’s blockchain club, led the Robotics Club, and worked at a fullstack role at Amazon for a year. 

Bored, I joined BitGo, a crypto custody startup that went from Series B to C in front of my eyes, while I hustled to scale and lead the EVM Integration Team by working on Threshold Signature Scheme wallets, fullstack wallet integration, and maintaining blockchain infra. I worked here for 2 years.

After losing the H1B visa lottery 4 times in a row (< 5% chance), I decided to backpack Europe for 2 months and join UCI for a 1 year Masters program. I'm spending this year working on personal projects and doing research. After graduating in June, I intend to work at an early stage software startup in a high impact role.
